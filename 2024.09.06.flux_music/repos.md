https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux

```
This repository houses FLUX, a text-to-image and image-to-image generation model developed by Black Forest Labs. Built on a latent rectified flow transformer architecture, FLUX is available in three variants: FLUX.1 [pro], [dev], and [schnell], with varying capabilities and licensing terms. The project is structured modularly, separating core model logic from demo applications, and utilizes PyTorch as its primary machine learning framework. While training scripts are not publicly visible, the repo provides utilities for model loading, image processing, and inference. The project leverages a diverse set of dependencies, including torchvision and Pillow for image handling, FastAPI for serving, and Streamlit and Gradio for interactive demos. It employs Poetry for dependency management and incorporates development tools like ruff for linting and pyright for type checking. The codebase hints at the use of design patterns such as Factory and potentially Singleton, though a comprehensive configuration management system is not apparent. The focus appears to be on providing a user-friendly interface for the pre-trained models, with features like NSFW content detection, image watermarking, and customizable sampling parameters.

https://github.com/feizc/FluxMusic

```
This repository implements a text-to-music generation model using a UNet architecture with diffusion-based techniques. The core of the model is the UNetModel class, which incorporates attention mechanisms, spatial transformers, and residual blocks. The model uses a combination of convolutional layers, self-attention, and cross-attention to process audio data conditioned on text input. The architecture includes timestep embeddings, allowing for the diffusion process, and supports various conditioning methods such as class labels and extra embedding vectors (e.g., from CLAP). The implementation leverages PyTorch and includes optimizations like gradient checkpointing for memory efficiency. The codebase also features custom dataset classes, samplers for handling audio data, and utilities for model training and inference. Key components include the QKVAttention mechanisms, ResBlock implementations, and the overall UNet structure with its input, middle, and output blocks. The model supports different configurations (small, base, large) and includes features like FiLM conditioning and the ability to predict discrete codebook IDs. The training process is set up for distributed training using PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel, with support for mixed-precision training and EMA model updates.

https://github.com/haoheliu/AudioLDM2

```
AudioLDM2 is a sophisticated text-to-audio generation system built on PyTorch, leveraging advanced deep learning techniques such as latent diffusion models, transformer architectures, and audio processing methods. The repository implements a modular architecture centered around the LatentDiffusion class, incorporating components like CLAP for audio embeddings, AudioMAE for feature extraction, and HiFi-GAN as a vocoder. It supports various audio generation tasks, including general sounds, music, and speech, with models available for different sample rates (16kHz and 48kHz). The system utilizes YAML configurations and command-line arguments for flexible setup, and offers a serving interface through a Gradio-based web application. Key functionalities include text-to-audio generation, super-resolution, and inpainting, with utilities for audio processing, model management, and visualization. While the focus appears to be on inference and serving pre-trained models, the architecture suggests potential for training capabilities. The project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to audio generation, combining state-of-the-art ML models with practical deployment considerations.
